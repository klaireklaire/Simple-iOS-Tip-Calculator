## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can select between tip percentages by using the tip percentage slider and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] UI animations
* [x] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Improving UI a little bit with some dynamic color scheme 
- [x] Enableing navigating between screens (Calculator and Settings)

## Notes

I struggled a lot because I have close to none experience in coding before (so far, I've only taken one introductory college course on Dr Scheme. I spent a lot of time familiarizing myself with Swift, especially on UserDefaults and Segue. There are a lot of other things that I have yet to learn, but now I understand how exciting it feels to actually complete a project!
